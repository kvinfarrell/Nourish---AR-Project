# Nourish: An Augmented Reality App for Nutrition Education

Nourish is an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to revolutionize the way we understand the food we consume. By using Assemblr and the Waterfall method, the application visually demonstrates the effects of various foods on the human body, offering users an immersive and educational experience. With a simple scan using a smartphone or tablet, users can view nutritional details and learn which organs are affected by specific food items.

## Features:
- **Interactive AR visualization** of food items (vegetables, fruits, meats).
- **Displays detailed nutritional information** and associated health benefits.
- **Simple and intuitive UI** to facilitate learning for all ages.
- Built with **Assemblr and Blender**, utilizing 3D modeling for educational purposes.
- Developed through comprehensive **Blackbox testing** for quality and performance assurance.

## Project Goals:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of AR technology in the health and education sectors, helping users better understand nutrition through visual and interactive experiences. We aim to bridge the gap between complex nutritional information and everyday health decisions.
